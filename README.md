Hello! This is our final JavaScript project for Week 6 at Promineo Tech. 
This project is called War.
It is a card game between two or more players.
The line of codes will execute the game by generating a total of 52 cards.
After 52 cards are created, it will shuffle, then split into 2 decks of 26 cards for Player One and Player Two.
Each round will declare who is the winner with the higher card.
At the end, the game will declare who is the winner overall with the most points.
